**\[Danger] impending risk**: If not conformed to, operator deaths or severe injuries may occur.
{% endhint %}

*   Perform a risk assessment on the entire system, not the individual devices. Connecting other devices to the product may increase the risk level of the product or create new risks. If the devices of the integrated robot system have different risk levels, prepare safety devices based on the device with the highest risk level in preparedness for risks.


*   In installing the robot product and other devices, make sure to read, fully understand, and conform to the product installation instructions described in the manual.


*   In case of any issues of the product, such as faults and damages, stop using the product immediately and contact our Customer Support Team.

*   Take adequate safety measures according to the result of risk assessment, and accurately assign the safe range of robot installation. During the robot operation, product damages or user injuries may occur.


*   Persons who manufacture robot application systems or use the robot must read and fully understand the manual and undergo training in robot operation.


*   For the safety of operators and users, prepare adequate safety facilities such as safety fences before installing the product.


*   Secure sufficient space so that the robot arm can move freely. During the robot operation, product damages or user injuries may occur.

    Fasten locking bolts to the specified torque according to the specification sheet. Loose bolts may lead to damages of the robot because of falling from the installation position.


*   Pay attention to the product connections (power and cables) so that no conductive substances, such as liquid, dust, and metal particles, could infiltrate. Do not poke the connection with sharp objects or apply excessive force during cable connection. Corrosion or temporary short circuits of connectors may lead to product explosion or fires.


*   Check the wiring specification and connect devices with terminals that are suitable for the device types. Make sure to connect safety devices to dedicated terminals because connecting them to general terminals does not guarantee safety functions.


*   Never use damaged cables and do not disconnect cables while the product is in use. Doing so may lead to electric shocks, fires, faults, and injuries.


*   Long-time use of the product may lead to overheating and cause injuries such as burns. In the event it is necessary to touch the product, cool down the product sufficiently by powering it off and leaving it for at least one hour.


*   Never arbitrarily install, modify, disassemble, or repair the product. This may lead to faults and accidents. Hyundai Robotics will not take responsibility for product damages caused by such arbitrary actions.
