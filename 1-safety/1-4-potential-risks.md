# 1.4 Potential risk

In the risk assessment of an integrated robot system, if the assessment result indicates that risk factors are not sufficiently removed only by the robotâ€™s safety functions, additional protective measures must be established.

In establishing additional protective measures, the following should be considered:

* Finger pinching \(entanglement\) between the robot base and the installation support during installation

* Injuries \(such as poking and piercing\) caused by sharp edges or protruding parts of obstacles or tools in the operating area

* Injuries caused by collision with the robot \(such as bruises, falling, and bone fractures\)

* Injuries caused by obstacles around the robot \(such as poking, piercing, and bone fractures\)

* Injuries caused by loose connections

* Injuries caused by toxic or hazardous substances under work \(such as skin damage and breathing disorders\)

* Displacement of objects under work caused by abrupt power shutoffs

* Erroneous activation of emergency stop switches caused by confusion with those of other equipment

* Errors caused by arbitrary modification of the Set up of safety functions



Because the types of potential risks vary depending on system compositions, a risk assessment must be carried out before using an integrated robot system.
