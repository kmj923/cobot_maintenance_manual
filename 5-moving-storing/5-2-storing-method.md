# 5.2 Storing method

In storing the collaborative robot without installing it, set it at the adequate posture and then store it, referring to the following instructions:

* The adequate robot posture for storing is the same as that for moving it.

* Store the collaborative robot as it is packaged, ensuring its power and communication connections are firmly sealed.

* In storing it for a long time, make sure to take safety measures to prevent it from tumbling.

* In storing the collaborative robot wrapped with packaging materials, store it at a dry place, or put moisture absorbent in the package. Storing the robot at a high-humidity place may create moisture inside the packaging material, which may cause product damages.

* In storing the collaborative robot, avoid a place of high variations in temperature and humidity \(where dew condensation occurs\), and store it at a dry and cool place of an ambient temperature between -15°C and 40°C.

* Do not store the collaborative robot at a place where chemicals, acid, or alkali products, batteries, circuit breakers, etc. are placed.
