# 5.1 Moving method

Check the weight and precautions for the collaborative robot. Move it using the proper method as follows, while paying attention to safety.

To move the collaborative robot manually, set it at the posture adequate for moving. Two or more workers lift it at the same time and move it to the target location.

**\[Caution\]**

* To move the collaborative robot manually, two or more workers should lift it at the same time and move it.

* When two or more workers move it at the same time, connections may be damaged. Therefore, take care not to damage them.

* Take care when putting down the collaborative robot on the floor, as the frame cover may be damaged.

To move the collaborative robot using a crane, set the robot at the posture adequate for lifting, connect it to the crane with sling belts, lift it, and move it to the target location.

* The adequate robot posture for lifting is the same as that for the manual moving.

  It is recommended to set the posture of the collaborative robot as it was released from the factory, referring to “[**5.1.1 Recommended posture**](1-recommend-posture.md).”

* The minimum capacity of the crane should be 0.2 t, while the weights of the collaborative robot models are as follows:

  YL005: 27 kg, YL012: 43 kg, YL015: 41 kg

**\[Warning\]**

* In moving the product using a crane, conform to the local and national safety regulations and the instructions for equipment use.

* In moving the product using a crane, ensure that no workers stand under the product. Never work or pass under the crane or the product.

**\[Caution\]**: If an auxiliary device is attached to the collaborative robot, lifting will become harder because the center of gravity of the robot will move to another point.
