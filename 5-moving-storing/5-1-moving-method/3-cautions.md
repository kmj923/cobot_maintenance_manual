# 5.1.3 Cautions

* Set the robot at an adequate posture for transportation and transport it in its packaging to prevent it from being damaged.

* In moving the collaborative robot manually, maintain the proper posture. If not done, the worker may incur physical injuries.

* To move the collaborative robot manually, two or more workers should lift it at the same time and then move it.

* When two or more workers move it at the same time, connections may be damaged. Therefore, take care not to damage them.

* In moving the collaborative robot using a crane, conform to the local and national safety regulations and the instructions for equipment use.

* After transporting the collaborative robot wrapped with packaging materials, store it at a dry place, or put moisture absorbent in the package. Storing the robot at a high-humidity place may create moisture inside the packaging material, which may cause product anomalies.
