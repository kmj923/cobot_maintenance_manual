# 3.9 Other safety precautions

* If the robot is operated manually without using the collaborative operation functions at a workplace where safety fences are installed for operating general industrial robots, all workers should stay out of the safeguarded space.

* Any protective devices that were temporarily stopped in a mode other than the automatic mode should be reactivated to function completely before entering the automatic mode. For example, automatic safeguard can be disabled in the manual mode. Before entering the automatic mode, the inputs of the automatic safeguard must be enabled.
