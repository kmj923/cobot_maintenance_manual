# 3.8 Movement without drive power

In case of emergency or occurrence of abnormal situations, you can configure the setting in such a way that the drive power of the robot is cut off and the axes can be moved for any workers isolated in the hazard area to make an emergency escape.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**\[Caution]**

*   If you release an axis of the robot when driving power is not applied to the robot, the axis may sag or drop. For safety, hold the axis using a device such as a crane that can support the axis before releasing it.


*   To prepare for emergencies and abnormal situations, all workers that install, use, and repair the robot system must undergo training in movement without driving power


{% endhint %}

Movement without drive power can be used by using the **\[Brake Release Function]** menu of the teach pendant.

1.  Return the safety input with the robot motor powered off.


2.  Touch the** \[Set up > 3 : Robot parameter > 36 : Brake Release Function]** menu on the teach pendant screen.


3. Check the robotâ€™s condition and release the brake on the desired axis.

* To release the brakes for all axes at once, touch the** \[All brake release on]** button. If you touch the **\[All brake release off]** button, the brakes of all axes are locked at once.
