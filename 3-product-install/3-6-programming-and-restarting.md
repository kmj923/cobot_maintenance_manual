# 3.6 Programming and restarting

If the robot system boots up normally upon powering on, and if there are no safety issues, you can carry out programming and restarting.

The robot will identify the existence of safety issues through self-diagnosis and check its conditions. After this process, you can configure the common setting of the robot and safety setting for collaborative operation. Check the final setting values, carry out programming, and restart it.

* For more details on how to set and operate the robot, see “[**Operation Manual for Hi6 Controllers**.](https://hyundai-robotics.gitbook.io/hi6-operation-manual)” 

* For the details on the safety setting of collaborative operation, see the “**Safety Function Manual for Collaborative Robots**.”
