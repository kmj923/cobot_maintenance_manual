**\[Caution\]**

* BD5B3T is a lower version of BD6B3H, please be careful with DSW1. DSW1 removed from BD6B3H.

* Set all the pins from 1 to 5 of BD5B3T DSW1 at the OFF position.

* If you set all the pins from 1 to 5 of BD5B3T DSW1 at the ON position, the pin combinations of 1-6, 2-7, 3-4, and 5-10 of the Terminal Block \(TB2\) will be short-circuited. Therefore, pay attention not to set them at the ON position.
