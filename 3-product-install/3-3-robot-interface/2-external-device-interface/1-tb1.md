# 3.3.2.1 Terminal block \(TB1\): common analog I/O signals

You can connect common analog I/O signals, two at a time, to Terminal Block, TB1. Select among five types of input/output ranges depending on the setting: -10 ~ +10 V, -5 ~ +5 V, 0 ~ 10 V, 0 ~ 5 V, and 4 ~ 20 mA. For more details on signal connection, see “**Safety Function Manual for Collaborative Robots**.”

**\[Caution\]**

* Set all the pins from 6 to 10 of BD6B3H DSW1 at the OFF position.

* If you set all the pins from 6 to 10 of BD6B3H DSW1 at the ON position, the pin combinations of 1-6, 2-7, 3-4, and 5-10 of the Terminal Block \(TB1\) will be short-circuited. Therefore, pay attention not to set them at the ON position.
