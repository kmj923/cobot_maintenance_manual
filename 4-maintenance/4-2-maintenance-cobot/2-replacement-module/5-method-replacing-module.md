# 4.2.2.5 Method for replacing the integrated driving module

Referring to “[**6.1 Block diagrams**](../../../6-appendix/6-1-block-diagrams/)” first identify the position and composition of the integrated driving module of each axis.

1.	Move the axis for which the integrated driving module will be replaced with the recommended posture.

2.	Power off the module by turning off the power breaker.

3.	Remove the bolts with a torque wrench, and remove the front or rear frame cover of the pertaining axis.

4.	Disconnect the wires of the integrated driving module.

5.	If it has a pneumatic hose, cut one end of the hose.

6.	Remove the bolts at the servo drive side using a torque wrench.

**\[Caution\]**: Retain the removed robot parts securely on a flat floor.
{% endhint %}



7.	Remove the bolts at the reducer with a torque wrench.

If you failed to set the robot at the recommended posture, release the brake by removing the brake connector of the servo drive, forcibly rotate the module, and remove the bolts.

8.	Apply Loctite 518 on the contacting surface of the replacement module.

9.	Replace the old module with a new one.

10.	Set the mounting position using the pin, and fixate the new module by fastening bolts with a torque wrench.

11.	Connect the wires of the integrated driving module.

12.	Using the one-touch straight fitting \(KQH23-00A1\), reconnect the pneumatic hose that was cut at Step 5.

13.	Put the front or rear frame cover on the axis, and fixate it by fastening bolts with a torque wrench.

14.	Referring to the “[**Encoder offset**](https://hyundai-robotics.gitbook.io/hi6-operation-manual/v/english/7-setting/7-4-robot-parameter/encoder-offset)” section of the “[**Operation Manual for Hi6 Controller**](https://hyundai-robotics.gitbook.io/hi6-operation-manual/v/english/),” correct the offset of the encoder of the axis of which the module has been replaced.



{% hint style="warning" %}
**\[Caution\]**: Before correcting the encoder offset, set the operation preparation at ON, and ensure that the power is connected by pressing the enabling switch of the teach pendant for two to three seconds.
{% endhint %}

15.	Run the robot, and check that it operates normally.
