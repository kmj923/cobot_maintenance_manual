# 4.2.2.1 Replacement timing

Replace the integrated driving module when any of the following anomalies is found:

* **Anomalies of reducers**

  If a reducer is damaged, abnormal noise and vibration will occur. An abnormal reducer may lead to overloading, abnormal deviation, and abnormal overheating that obstruct normal operation. It may also make the robot stop or create a deviation in its position. In such cases, replace the integrated driving module.

  The integrated driving module should also be replaced when the grease is replaced.  ****

  \*\*\*\*

* **Anomalies of motors**

  An abnormal motor may lead to abnormal operations such as shaking at stopping, vibration in operation, and irregular cycles \(pulsation\). It may also generate abnormal noise and overheating.

  The phenomena of abnormal motors are similar to those of reducers. In such cases, replace the integrated driving module, and contact our Customer Support Team to request analysis.  ****

* **Anomalies of the brake**

  An abnormal brake will make the axes fall in the operation ready \[brake OFF\] state or generate overloading and abnormal noise by being actuated in the operation ready \[brake ON\] state. You can check on anomalies of the brake by the following methods:



  * While the motor is not turned on, turn ON the brake release switch so that the robot can be moved. Before turning ON the brake release switch, take actions so that the robot arm cannot fall by gravity.



  * In the operation ready state, turn the brake release switch ON/OFF, and check that the brake operation sound is heard. In most cases, if the brake operation sound is not heard, there is a wire disconnection. In such a case, replace the integrated driving module.    ****

**\[Caution\]**

* Take precautions because the robot arm may fall when the brake release switch is turned ON/OFF.

* The brake release switch is on the circuit board placed near the door inside the controller.

* **Anomalies of the encoder**

  An abnormal encoder will lead to deviation in position, malfunction, rush, etc. It may also lead to shaking at stopping and irregular cycles \(pulsation\). In such cases, check the error code through the teach pendant, and replace the integrated driving module as necessary. Phenomena such as abnormal mechanical noise, overheating, and vibration are not related to anomalies of the encoder.  ****

**\[Caution\]**

* In replacing the integrated driving module, it is likely that the worker will place some parts on the floor. Before the replacement, secure the area so that no parts can be lost or damaged.

* Replacement of the integrated driving module must be carried out by qualified experts who have taken the relevant training provided by Hyundai Robotics. In the event it is necessary to replace the integrated driving module, contact our Customer Support Team to consign the work to experts.

* After the robot is stopped and before the worker touches the integrated driving module, its temperature should be checked.

* In the case of the gigabit Ethernet option, because the module replacement is not simple, contact our Customer Support Team to consign the work to experts.
