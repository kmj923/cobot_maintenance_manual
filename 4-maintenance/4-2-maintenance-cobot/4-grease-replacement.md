# 4.2.4 Grease replacement

Because the collaborative robot uses harmonic reducers, it does not require grease replacement at regular intervals.

* However, because cases may occur where the grease should be replaced depending on the service environment of the robot, check on abnormal noise or temperature of the reducers at regular intervals.

* Grease replacement requires the replacement of the integrated driving module. If grease replacement is necessary, contact our Customer Support Team.
