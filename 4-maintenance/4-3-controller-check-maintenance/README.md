# 4.3 Controller check and maintenance

Because the controller is fixated to a floor, it is not subject to mechanical damages. Therefore, the controller does not need to be checked for mechanical damages over the course of its service life. However, when the controller is repositioned or when it has been impacted, its cables and connectors must be checked.
