# 4.1.2 Wiring check

The internal wiring of the collaborative robot uses cables that can withstand bending. Because disconnection or short circuit caused by damaged cables may lead to malfunction of the robot, make sure to check on the wiring at regular intervals.

Before starting activities such as robot teaching within the operating space of the robot \(excluding cases where the driving power of the industrial robot is cut off\), make sure to check the following safety check requirements. If any problems are found, resolve them and take necessary actions immediately.

* Check on damaged shields and cables of the external power source.

* Check on the malfunction of the robot manipulator.

* Check on the operability of the emergency stop function.
