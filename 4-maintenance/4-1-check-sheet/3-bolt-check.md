# 4.1.3 Bolt check

Check on the major bolts and the recommended fastening torques. Because the bolts to be checked vary depending on operations carried out by the robot, contact our Customer Support Team for more details.

Fasten the bolts mounting the integrated driving module of each axis with a torque wrench to adequate torques, and mark them with paint.
